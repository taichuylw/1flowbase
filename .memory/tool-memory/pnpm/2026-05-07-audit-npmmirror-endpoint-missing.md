# pnpm audit fails against npmmirror

## Failure

`pnpm audit` failed with:

```text
ERR_PNPM_AUDIT_ENDPOINT_NOT_EXISTS
https://registry.npmmirror.com/-/npm/v1/security/audits
```

## Verified Fix

Run audit against the npm official registry:

```bash
pnpm --dir web audit --audit-level high --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
pnpm --dir tmp/demo audit --audit-level moderate --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

Both commands returned `No known vulnerabilities found` after the dependency lockfile fixes on `2026-05-07 01`.

Reverified on `2026-05-11 18`: `pnpm audit --json` still fails against `npmmirror`, and `pnpm audit --json --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org` reaches the official audit endpoint successfully.
