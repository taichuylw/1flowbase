# GitHub Automation

This directory owns GitHub Actions automation for repository quality gates.

## Files

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/verify.yml` | Automatic CI for `pull_request` and `push` to `main` / `latest`; only `latest` push publishes quality-gate issues. |
| `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml` | Manual and nightly quality gate run that creates one new GitHub Issue report per run. |
| `.github/actions/quality-gate/action.yml` | Reusable repository-local action used by CI and manual quality gates. |

## Automatic CI

`verify.yml` runs automatically on:

- `pull_request`
- `push` to `main`
- `push` to `latest`

It calls the local Quality Gate Action with:

```yaml
scope: ci
report_type: ci
publish_issue: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/latest' }}
```

Automatic CI creates a GitHub Issue only for `latest` branch pushes and uploads
`tmp/test-governance` as the `test-governance-artifacts` artifact. The issue body includes
the quality gate result summary, warning status, coverage percentages, evidence paths, and
a failure excerpt when the gate fails. Use the artifact for full logs and raw coverage files.
Runs use branch-level concurrency, so a newer push cancels an older in-progress quality gate
for the same branch before stale runs can publish or close quality issues.

## Manual Quality Gate

`quality-gate.yml` is triggered from GitHub Actions with `workflow_dispatch` and by a daily
schedule at 18:00 UTC, which is 02:00 Asia/Shanghai.

Recommended first run:

```text
scope: ci
report_type: ci
environment: leave empty
```

Manual runs call the same Quality Gate Action with `publish_issue: "true"`. Each manual run
creates a new GitHub Issue. It does not reuse a fixed Issue and does not append comments to
old reports.
Manual runs share the same target-branch concurrency group as automatic quality gates.
Scheduled runs target `latest`, use `scope: ci`, set `environment: nightly-latest`, publish
one Issue report, and upload the same `test-governance-artifacts` artifact.

## Scope Options

| Scope | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `ci` | `node scripts/node/verify-ci.js` |
| `repo` | `node scripts/node/verify-repo.js` |
| `backend` | `node scripts/node/verify-backend.js` |
| `backend-consistency` | `node scripts/node/verify-backend-consistency.js` |
| `coverage` | `node scripts/node/verify-coverage.js all` |

Use `ci` for the full repository quality gate. It includes the online-only backend
consistency pass between the repo gate and coverage gate. Use narrower scopes only when
debugging or when a faster targeted report is enough. Do not run the backend consistency
scope locally unless explicitly requested, because it exercises database-backed Rust suites.

## Report Type

| `report_type` | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| `ci` | Code quality, regression, or repository validation. |
| `cd` | Deployment or release validation. |

For `cd` reports, set `environment` to a value such as `staging` or `production`.

## Evidence

The Quality Gate Action writes:

- `tmp/test-governance/quality-gate.latest.log`
- `tmp/test-governance/quality-gate-report.md`
- `tmp/test-governance/quality-gate-report.json`
- `tmp/test-governance/backend-consistency-targets.json` for `ci` and `backend-consistency`

Existing warning, coverage, screenshot, and QA evidence files remain under
`tmp/test-governance/`.
For `ci` and `backend-consistency` scopes, the report also includes the current backend
consistency target results: label, Cargo package, Rust test filter, status, duration,
passed count, and failed count. If the target result artifact is unavailable, the report
falls back to the static target registry with `not_run` status.

## Setup Order

Workflows must install pnpm before enabling `setup-node` pnpm cache:

```yaml
- uses: pnpm/action-setup@v5
- uses: actions/setup-node@v5
  with:
    cache: pnpm
```

Putting `setup-node` before `pnpm/action-setup` can fail with `Unable to locate executable
file: pnpm`.
